# DDTBOX Documentation and Tutorials

*Nice intro message*

This documentation aims to clearly explain the main features of the Decision Decoding ToolBOX (DDTBOX) and how this toolbox can be used to perform multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) on EEG and other data. The documentation contains explanations and tutorials for those who want to use MVPA on their data. Advanced sections contain information about the structure of the toolbox for those who would like to perform nonstandard analyses or add new features to the toolbox.
